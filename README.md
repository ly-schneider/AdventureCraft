# AdventureCraft

A game made in a few hours at the [PlayBern 2020 Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/playbern) with the theme "Games Without Borders".

> You are Jester, a survivor trying to survive in a world filled with infected zombies everywhere. You have a iron sword and a iron armour. You have managed to survive several months avoiding zombies and scavenging food.

This prototype game REQUIRES a webcam as an input device. Hold up your fist to attack. Hold up the palm of your hand to defend when the zombie is looking.

## Technical details
